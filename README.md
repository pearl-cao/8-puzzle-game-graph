# 8-puzzle-game-graph

A Python script that generates and maps the complete state space of the classic 8-puzzle problem as a graph.

It uses the Ultipa Python SDK to create "state" nodes for every possible puzzle configuration and "moves" edges for all legal tile transitions. This project serves as a practical example of how to model and store a complex problem space in a graph database, enabling further analysis like finding the shortest path to a solution using graph algorithms.

You can setup an Ultipa instance on Ultipa Cloud (https://cloud.ultipa.com/).
